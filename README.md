# 🚀 PIC16F877A – MPLAB X Projects (XC8)

This repository contains a collection of **basic to intermediate embedded C projects** developed and implemented **entirely by me** using the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**, **MPLAB X IDE**, and the **XC8 compiler**.
All projects are **designed, coded, tested, and simulated by me** using **PICSimLab** as part of my hands-on learning and practical embedded systems development.

These projects demonstrate my understanding of **microcontroller architecture**, **digital I/O control**, and **embedded C programming**.
